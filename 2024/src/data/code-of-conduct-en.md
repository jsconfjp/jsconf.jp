title: Code of Conduct
---

This Code of Conduct was adapted from [JSConf EU’s Code of Conduct](https://2019.jsconf.eu/code-of-conduct/) to fit Japanese culture and language. JSConf EU’s Code of Conduct was in turn based on [CSSConf / JSConf AU, The Geek Feminism Wiki](http://jsconfau.com/), the work of [Valerie Aurora](https://frameshiftconsulting.com/code-of-conduct-training/) and [Conference Code of Conduct](https://confcodeofconduct.com).

## PURPOSE

JSConf JP is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion or lack thereof. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks. Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference without a refund at the discretion of the conference organisers.

## ANTI-HARASSMENT

Harassment includes, but is not limited to:

Verbal comments that reinforce social structures of domination related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion
Sexual images in public spaces
Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following
Harassing photography or recording
Sustained disruption of talks or other events
Inappropriate physical contact
Invasion of personal space
Unwelcome sexual attention
Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviour

## ENFORCEMENT

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, event organisers retain the right to take any actions to keep the event a welcoming environment for all participants. This includes warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund.

Event organisers may take action to address anything designed to, or with the clear impact of, disrupting the event or making the environment hostile for any participants. We expect participants to follow these rules at all event venues and event-related social activities. We think people should follow these rules outside event activities too

## Reporting

If someone makes you or anyone else feel unsafe or unwelcome, please report it as soon as possible. Harassment and other Code of Conduct violations reduce the value of our event for everyone. We want you to be happy at our event. People like you make our event a better place. You can make a report either personally or anonymously.

### Anonymous Report

[You can file an anonymous report here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScVFhe-TDgsEowLTZgRlKBfSpWJ0FH8d2XxKfwVBe2uuFMdFQ/viewform). We can’t follow up an anonymous report with you directly, but we will fully investigate it and take whatever action is necessary to prevent a recurrence.

### Personal report

You can make a personal report in two ways:

Talk to a staff member directly. (Staff identification details will be updated soon.)
Email: yosuke_furukawa@nodejs.jp
When taking a personal report, our staff will ensure you are safe and cannot be overheard. They may involve other event staff to ensure your report is managed properly. Once safe, we’ll ask you to tell us about what happened. This can be upsetting, but we’ll handle it as respectfully as possible. You won’t be asked to confront anyone and we won’t tell anyone who you are.

### Important contacts

Police: 110 (no need for a SIM card or to unlock your phone)
Medical emergency: 119 (no need for a SIM card or to unlock your phone)
Our staff can assist you in contacting any of the above numbers or escorting you to where you will feel safe.

## Photo policy

Whether you agree to be photographed will be indicated through your lanyard.

Information on how to distinguish will be updated soon.

In case of any doubt, please ask before taking photographs of attendees, speakers or staff.

## INCLUSIVE LANGUAGE

Any speech that reinforce harmful stereotypes is unwelcome. Examples include but are not limited to:

Making undue assumptions and/or sweeping generalizations about a group of people.
Any language that deems disability a defect.
Any unwelcome comments on one’s physical appearance.
