I’m an independent full time open source developer. I work on projects in the TypeScript ecosystem, most notably typescript-eslint: the tooling that enables ESLint and Prettier to run on TypeScript code. I’m also the author of the O’Reilly Learning TypeScript book, a Microsoft MVP for developer technologies, and an active conference speaker. My personal projects range from static analysis to meta-languages to recreating retro games in the browser.

How about before your code even gets run? Static analysis tools scrutinize your code as you write it - giving you blazing fast feedback at development time. We’re going to go into how that works, why it’s useful, and -best of all- how to enable the best configurations for ESLint, TypeScript, and their associated tooling in your app.\n\nIn particular, we'll cover:\n* The tooling differences between formatters, linters, and type checkers\n* How to appropriately set up each of those tools for local development and CI/builds\n* A brief overview of using recommended rulesets from ESLint and TypeScript-ESLint -- and why you'd want to\n* The kinds of development-time issues each of those tools catch\n* Using ESLint and TypeScript as documentation sources and to educate developers on best practices\n* Demos of the -often surprisingly intricate- well-crafted static analysis tools can catch in your code\n\nA primary goal of the talk is to get the audience excited about the tooling they can run on their code. This talk will have you detecting bugs, bad practices, and code smells in your web apps at lightning speed! ⚡️","descriptionJa":null,"spokenLanguage":"en","slideLanguage":"en","slidesEn":null,"slidesJa":null,"speakerIDs":["josh-goldberg"],"sponsorIDs":[],"presenterName":null,"presenterNameReading":null,"date":"day1","startsAt":"15:30","endsAt":"16:00","room":"A","youtube":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZBkN1ciLrU"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1861792574","2652256293","2737205312"],"slicesMap":{}}
