With a whole existing and upcoming ecosystem of libraries and frameworks around JavaScript, the need for thorough understanding of code execution on the web becomes more relevant. This knowledge also helps you to better understand and distinguish technologies like WebAssembly from JavaScript.\n\nAttend this talk to get an in-depth overview of the JavaScript engine and learn how it can help you as a developer to write more optimized JavaScript code. You will learn how exactly your high-level code is converted to bytecode and then to the optimized machine code with the magic of the V8 engine.\n\nThe key session highlights include:\n1. Intro to JS engines and the V8 engine evolution\n2. Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)\n3. Ignition, Bytecode and Turbofan\n4. Hidden classes and Inline caching\n5. Garbage collection\n6.
