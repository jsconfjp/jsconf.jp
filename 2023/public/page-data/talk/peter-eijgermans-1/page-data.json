This architectural approach not only enhances team effectiveness and efficiency but also unlocks new possibilities.\n\nPeter begins by sharing an engaging anecdote of his adventure with a rhinoceros in Nepal, drawing parallels with the concept of monoliths that need to be overcome before embracing micro frontends. The presentation then focuses on establishing a robust Micro Frontends architecture, providing attendees with valuable insights into best practices, determining when and why to utilize micro frontends, and taking the initial steps towards implementation.\n\nMoreover, Peter showcases strategies for converting a monolith into a micro frontend application, offering practical guidance and demonstrating real-world scenarios.\n\nOne of the key aspects covered is establishing seamless communication between Micro Frontends, ensuring smooth collaboration and integration within the architecture.","descriptionJa":null,"spokenLanguage":"en","slideLanguage":"en","slidesEn":"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1XmnkwTXcjUcAD40x-F658EnGrjulJF1B/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=105236729432728057097&rtpof=true&sd=true","slidesJa":null,"speakerIDs":["peter-eijgermans"],"sponsorIDs":[],"presenterName":null,"presenterNameReading":null,"date":"day1","startsAt":"13:00","endsAt":"13:30","room":"C","youtube":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEioyYxGaX4"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1861792574","2652256293","2737205312"],"slicesMap":{}}
