Creating checklists, understanding end users and targeting diverse audiences all leads to success of an application or product. The very understanding of these accessibilities needs from a Neurodivergent perspectives is what I would like to emphasize on. A web page containing JavaScript will typically be fully accessible if the functionality of the script is device independent (does not require only a mouse or only a keyboard) and the information (content) is available to assistive technologies. There is no easy fix that can be applied to solve all accessibility problems associated with JavaScript. The only way to ensure JavaScript accessibility is by evaluating each page that utilizes scripting and devising a unique solution to any accessibility problem found. I would like to recommend a handy cheatsheet or checklist which I have been working on which can ease the evaluation process for the developers. Understanding the grassroot problems and addressing the needs of it technically is what can help in resulting great tools and products for the future. I strongly believe that accessibility is no more a feature but an essential component of a product that needs to be considered even before the development.","descriptionJa":"(Untranslated) In this talk I would like to highlight about what application developers who use JavaScripts can add accessibility to their agenda. Creating checklists, understanding end users and targeting diverse audiences all leads to success of an application or product. The very understanding of these accessibilities needs from a Neurodivergent perspectives is what I would like to emphasize on. A web page containing JavaScript will typically be fully accessible if the functionality of the script is device independent (does not require only a mouse or only a keyboard) and the information (content) is available to assistive technologies. There is no easy fix that can be applied to solve all accessibility problems associated with JavaScript. The only way to ensure JavaScript accessibility is by evaluating each page that utilizes scripting and devising a unique solution to any accessibility problem found. I would like to recommend a handy cheatsheet or checklist which I have been working on which can ease the evaluation process for the developers. Understanding the grassroot problems and addressing the needs of it technically is what can help in resulting great tools and products for the future. I strongly believe that accessibility is no more a feature but an essential component of a product that needs to be considered even before the development.","spokenLanguage":"en","slideLanguage":"en","speakerIDs":["bhuvana-meenakshi-koteeswaran"]}},{"node":{"uuid":"secret-shortcuts-of-loading-web-performance","title":"Secret Shortcuts of Loading Web Performance","titleJa":"Secret Shortcuts of Loading Web Performance","description":"In this presentation, we talk about how to optimize the delivery of the files on which your web application depends (HTML, CSS, JS, images, etc.).\nHow to effectively watch out for your JS bundle size and split it into multiple chunks with techniques like lazy loading?\nHow to apply advanced caching strategies with the help of Cache API and Service Workers so we don't request the same files all over again?\nHow to minimize and compress files over the network to make them the smallest possible?
