  description: >-
    Did you know that 90% of time spent on most web pages is after page load? In this span of time, users are interacting with your website through a series of interactions such as clicks, taps, and keyboard inputs—and the slower your website is to respond to those interactions, the more likely your users will have a negative user experience with your website.

    At Google, we've invested significant time in creating new metrics to assess page responsiveness. One of these metrics is First Input Delay (FID), which is a load responsiveness metric that captures the input delay of the first interaction. However, we discovered that we needed a new responsiveness metric that samples more than just the first interaction—and more than simply that interaction's input delay.

    In order to comprehensively assess overall page responsiveness, we've created the new Interaction to Next Paint (INP) metric. INP samples all page interactions, and goes beyond measuring just the input delay. In this talk, you'll find out all about INP, how it works, why it matters, how you can measure it, and how you can improve it.

    DMMプラットフォーム事業本部では、多くの事業・アプリケーションが効率的かつ独立して開発できることをめざし、昨年からフロントエンドのエコシステム開発に取り組んでいます。発表では、DMM PFで取り組んだフロントエンドのエコシステム開発についてお話できればと思います。モノレポファーストを念頭に、効率的かつ自律性を損なわない組織開発について共有いたします。

    ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー
    モノレポによるエコシステムをベースとし、現時点で約10のアプリケーション(まだまだ増える予定です)を運用していて、下記の仕組みを提供しています。

    ・車輪の再発明を防ぐモノレポによるパッケージエコシステム
    ・一貫性のあるUIを提供するためのデザインシステム Turtle
    ・最適なキャッシュ戦略を提供する静的アセット配信基盤 Panda

    モノレポはエコシステムの提供を楽にできますが、スケーラビリティの面でいくつかのチャレンジがあると考えています。私たちの場合では以下に取り組んでいます。

    ・スケーラブルなCI/CD基盤
    ・Next.js, Reactをベースとたアプリケーションジェネレーター
    ・コードレビュー、ドキュメンテーションによる技術水準向上

    また、将来的な展望として、以下をロードマップとして見据えています。

    ・共通ヘッダー改修による全社レスポンシブ化
    ・フロントエンドのインフラ基盤
    ・マイクロフロントエンド基盤

    React Hooks と GraphQL の台頭により、近年の SPA 開発は大きく変化したかと思います。Redux のような状態管理ライブラリを導入すること無しに、UI に即した Read Model を API Client のキャッシュ機構に持たせることで、クライアントサイドの構造を薄く保つことが可能になりました。

    構造を薄く保つことは開発体験の向上にも繋がりますし、状態管理ライブラリのある種の複雑さに対する揺り戻しも相まってか、クライアントサイドで設計を作り込むことに対する疑心も、さまざまな場面で言及されているように感じます。

    さて、設計の戦略・戦術は多くのものが存在しますが、中でも DDD: Domain Driven Design は、しばしばエンジニアの関心を引くと同時に、頭を悩ませているものの1つでしょう。

    このセッションでは、クライアントサイドの構造を薄く保ちながら、いかに DDD のような手法の恩恵を得るかを、考察してみたいと思います。

    We published some of our learnings and received overwhelmingly positive reactions from developers worldwide such as:

    1. Selected as the top article of the week by various newsletters

    2. Developers voluntarily translated the article into many languages such as South Korean and Russian

    3. Reached 100K+ developers with comments such as “Changed my day!”

How would you like a computer telling you, ""*your name makes my processor hurt; choose something 'better'*""?

    I'm going to run you through some of the *many* ways in which testers, developers and systems designers get demographic data wrong. We'll burn down our assumptions about what's ""Correct"" in names, timezones, addresses and more, one after another, leaving us with a smoking heap of despair. Our test data will be rent asunder. Our schemas will weep.

    But what kind of Engineer would I be if I only left you there?! We can rebuild: We have the technology! We'll see some practical suggestions for building flexible data schemas and learn how to craft clever tests that force system designers to account for reality.

    In this talk I would like to highlight about what application developers who use JavaScripts can add accessibility to their agenda. Creating checklists, understanding end users and targeting diverse audiences all leads to success of an application or product. The very understanding of these accessibilities needs from a Neurodivergent perspectives is what I would like to emphasize on. A web page containing JavaScript will typically be fully accessible if the functionality of the script is device independent (does not require only a mouse or only a keyboard) and the information (content) is available to assistive technologies. There is no easy fix that can be applied to solve all accessibility problems associated with JavaScript. The only way to ensure JavaScript accessibility is by evaluating each page that utilizes scripting and devising a unique solution to any accessibility problem found. I would like to recommend a handy cheatsheet or checklist which I have been working on which can ease the evaluation process for the developers. Understanding the grassroot problems and addressing the needs of it technically is what can help in resulting great tools and products for the future. I strongly believe that accessibility is no more a feature but an essential component of a product that needs to be considered even before the development.

Moving on to more practical examples, we check the concepts behind the related Remix APIs (loader function, action function, useLoaderData , useActionData,  useTransition,  useFetcher), and finally: some live-coding to illustrate what we have all discussed - we create a DB table on stage so we can query and mutate data.

    JavaScript Testing Framework: Under the Hood
  description: >-
    In this LT, I'm not going to talk about ""how to set up a test framework"", ""how to run `.test.ts` files"", ""how to use ESM in tests?"", etc. in JavaScript.
    Instead, I will introduce the internal workings of a test framework(like Jest, Vitest, etc.) through simple demos, so that you can get a general idea of how they work.
    I hope this LT will spark your interest , make you dive into the code reading.
  descriptionJa: >-
    このLTではJavaScriptにおける""テストフレームワークのセットアップの仕方""や"".tsファイルのテスト実行の仕方""、""テストをESM対応するには？""といった話は一切しません。
    代わりに普段なぜ動いているのか気にすることのないテストフレームワーク(JestやVitestなど)の内部動作を簡易的なデモを通して紹介し、大まかな動作の流れを掴むことを目的とします。
    LTを通してコードリーディングや興味のきっかけになれば幸いです。

  description: >-
    Real-time and offline applications have opened the door to premium, native-like experiences on the web. These features have set sites apart from their competition, allowing Google Docs to dethrone Microsoft Word, Figma to overtake Sketch, and Slack to nearly replace email.
    "The underlying magic powering many of these sites is CRDTs: Conflict-free replicated data types — a type of data structure used in distributed applications. Despite the daunting-sounding jargon, CRDTs as tool in your toolkit can be understood and used pretty simply."
    By walking through an example of a to-do list application, we'll see how a traditional approach to managing a todo list state may begin to break when using it while offline. Having users edit the same to-do list items simultaneously can lead to an incorrect or corrupt state.
    We'll then gradually convert the application state to use the three CRDT principles: commutativity, associativity, and idempotency, to make it resilient to changes being made concurrently or offline.
    Finally, we'll briefly demonstrate examples of real-world applications using CRDTs in production and what their underlying design might look like. In the end, attendees should know enough of the basics of CRDTs to put them into practice in apps they're developing today.
